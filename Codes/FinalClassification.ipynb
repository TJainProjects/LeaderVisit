Chinese Government on the Middle East Issue met with Bahraini Foreign Minister Abdullatif bin Rashid Al Zayani on the sidelines of the 20th Manama Dialogue in Bahrain, where they had an exchange of views on bilateral relations and the situation in the Middle East.Zhai Jun said that in May this year, King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa paid a successful state visit to China. President Xi Jinping and King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa jointly announced the elevation of China-Bahrain relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership, opening a new chapter in bilateral relations. China is ready to work with Bahrain to deliver on the important common understandings reached between the two heads of state and push for new progress in China-Bahrain relations. The conflict in Gaza has lasted for more than one year, and its spillover effects continue to spread, posing a risk of further deterioration of the regional situation. The international community should further build consensus and bring the Palestinian question back to the right track of the two-State solution. China is ready to strengthen coordination and cooperation with Bahrain and other Arab countries to promote lasting peace and stability in the region.Abdullatif bin Rashid Al Zayani said, King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa's visit to China has achieved fruitful results. Bahrain is ready to continue deepening friendly cooperation with China in various fields and push the Bahrain-China comprehensive strategic partnership to a higher level. Bahrain highly appreciates China's long-term support for the just cause of the Palestinian people, thanks China for its positive contribution to deescalating regional tensions, and stands ready to strengthen communication and coordination with China in regional and international affairs to jointly promote regional peace, stability and development.Links:State CouncilMinistry of CommerceNational

It is a grave concern of the international community. President Xi Jinping stated China’s principled position on the current Palestinian-Israeli situation on a number of occasions. He stressed the need for an immediate ceasefire and ending the fighting, ensuring that the humanitarian corridors are safe and unimpeded, and preventing the expansion of the conflict. He pointed out that the fundamental way out of this lies in the two-state solution, building international consensus\\u2002for peace,\\u2002and working toward a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the Palestinian question at an early date.Pursuant to the Charter\\u2002of the United Nations, the Security Council shoulders\\u2002primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, and should thus play an\\u2002active and constructive role on the question of Palestine. In this connection, China\\u2002offers the following proposals:1.\\u2002Implementing a comprehensive ceasefire and ending the fighting. Parties to the conflict should truly implement the\\u2002relevant UNGA and UNSC resolutions and immediately realize a durable and sustained humanitarian truce.\\u2002Building on UNSC Resolution 2712, the Security Council, in\\u2002response to the calls\\u2002of the international community, should\\u2002explicitly demand a comprehensive ceasefire\\u2002and end of the fighting, work for deescalation of the conflict, and cool down the situation\\u2002as soon as possible.2.\\u2002Protecting\\u2002civilians\\u2002effectively. The UNSC resolution demands in explicit terms that all parties comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law, notably with regard to the protection of civilians. It is imperative to stop any violent attacks against civilians and violations of international humanitarian law,\\u2002and avoid attacks\\u2002on civilian facilities. The Security Council should\\u2002further send a clear message on opposing forced transfer of the Palestinian civilian population,\\u2002preventing the displacement of Palestinian civilians, and calling for the release of all civilians and hostages held captive\\u2002as soon as possible.3.\\u2002Ensuring\\u2002humanitarian assistance. All relevant parties must, as per requirements\\u2002of the UNSC resolution, refrain from depriving the civilian population in Gaza of supplies and services indispensable to their survival, set up humanitarian corridors in Gaza to enable rapid, safe, unhindered and sustainable humanitarian access, and avoid a humanitarian disaster of even greater gravity. The Security Council should encourage the international community to ramp up humanitarian assistance,\\u2002improve\\u2002the humanitarian situation on the ground, and support the coordinating role of\\u2002the\\u2002United Nations\\u2002as well as the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) in humanitarian assistance, and prepare the international community for supporting\\u2002post-conflict reconstruction in Gaza.4.\\u2002Enhancing diplomatic mediation. The Security Council should leverage its\\u2002role\\u2002in facilitating peace\\u2002as mandated\\u2002in the UN\\u2002Charter\\u2002to demand that parties to the conflict exercise restraint to prevent\\u2002the conflict from widening and uphold\\u2002peace and stability in the Middle East. The Security Council should value\\u2002the role of regional countries and organizations, support the good offices of the UN Secretary General and the Secretariat, and encourage countries with influence on parties to the conflict to uphold an objective and just\\u2002position\\u2002so as to jointly play\\u2002a constructive role in deescalating the crisis.5. Seeking political settlement. According\\u2002to relevant UNSC resolutions and\\u2002international consensus, the fundamental settlement of the question of Palestine lies in the\\u2002implementation of the two-state solution, restoration of the legitimate national rights of Palestine, and the\\u2002establishment of an independent State of Palestine that enjoys full sovereignty based on the 1967 border and with east Jerusalem as its capital. The Security Council should help restore the two-state solution. A more broad-based, authoritative and effective international peace conference led and organized by the UN should be held as soon as possible to formulate a concrete\\u2002timetable and roadmap for the implementation of the two-state solution\\u2002and facilitate a comprehensive, just and lasting solution to the question of Palestine. Any arrangement on the future of Gaza must respect the will and independent choice of the Palestinian people, and must not be imposed upon them.Links:State CouncilMinistry of CommerceNational Development and Reform CommissionNational Immigration AdministrationCopyright©www.fmprc.gov.cnAddress: 2 Chaoyangmen Nandajie, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100701Tel: 86 - 10 - 65961114\", 'labels': ['1: Symbolic', '3: Strategic ', '2: Economic/diplomatic deal', '0: No data'], 'scores': [0.3801739811897278, 0.28636083006858826, 0.21196399629116058, 0.12150121480226517]}\n","{'sequence': \"Assistant Foreign Minister Nong Rong Meets with Iranian Ambassador to China Mohsen Bakhtiar_Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of ChinaIPCVisasEnglishEN简体中文FrançaisРусскийEspañolعربيMinistry of Foreign AffairsThe People’s Republic of ChinaThe MinistryMain ResponsibilitiesThe MinisterPrincipal OfficialsDepartmentsRelated AgenciesNewsTop StoriesSpeechesDiplomatic ScheduleNew AmbassadorsMFA NewsSpokesperson’s RemarksNews from Overseas MissionsResourcesCommuniquésForeign PoliciesIn FocusDiplomatic HistoryDiplomatic FiguresProtocol AffairsOverseas MissionsChinese EmbassiesChinese Consulates GeneralChinese Missions to International Organizations and Representative Offices AbroadCountries and RegionsAsiaAfricaEuropeNorth AmericaSouth\\xa0AmericaOceaniaABOUT CHINAHOMETHE MINISTRYMain ResponsibilitiesThe MinisterPrincipal OfficialsDepartmentsRelated AgenciesNEWSTop StoriesSpeechesDiplomatic ScheduleNew AmbassadorsMFA NewsSpokesperson’s RemarksNews from Overseas MissionsRESOURCESCommuniquésForeign PoliciesIn FocusDiplomatic HistoryDiplomatic FiguresProtocol AffairsOVERSEAS MISSIONSChinese EmbassiesChinese Consulates GeneralChinese Missions to International Organizations and Representative Offices AbroadCOUNTRIES AND REGIONSAsiaAfricaEuropeNorth AmericaSouth\\xa0AmericaOceaniaABOUT CHINAHomeNewsMFA NewsAssistant Foreign Minister Nong Rong Meets with Iranian Ambassador to China Mohsen BakhtiarUpdated:December 26, 2023 17:37On December 25, 2023, Assistant Foreign Minister Nong Rong met with Iranian Ambassador to China Mohsen Bakhtiar.Nong Rong said that in recent years, under the strategic guidance of President Xi Jinping and President Ebrahim Raisi, China-Iran relations have made great progress.
