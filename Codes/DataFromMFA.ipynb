On January 1 this year, President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden exchanged congratulatory letters on the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, emphasizing the commitment to stabilizing and developing the bilateral relationship for the benefits of both countries and the world. The three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation proposed by President Xi Jinping are the fundamental guidelines for China in handling its relationship with the United States. China and the United States should respect each other's social systems and development paths, and refrain from interfering in each other's internal affairs, obstructing or containing each other's development, or undermining each other's core interests. Confrontation has no way out, the \"new Cold War\" has no winner, and cooperation is the only correct choice for the two countries. China is firmly determined to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests, and no external force can stop China's development and growth.Ma Zhaoxu pointed out that the Resolution adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee has drawn a grand blueprint for China to further deepen reform comprehensively, which will not only greatly advance Chinese modernization, but also create broader space for the development of enterprises from various countries, including the United States, in China. He hoped that the United States will work with China in the same direction, earnestly implement the important common understandings reached by the two heads of state at the San Francisco Summit meeting, establish a correct understanding, strengthen practical cooperation, deepen cultural and people-to-people exchanges, and promote the steady and long-term development of China-U.S. relations.Links:State CouncilMinistry of CommerceNational Development and Reform CommissionNational Immigration AdministrationCopyright©www.fmprc.gov.cnAddress: 2 Chaoyangmen Nandajie, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100701Tel: 86 - 10 - 65961114\n","Country: United States\n","Continent: America\n","Developed country: 1\n","Developing country: 0\n","Communist country: 0\n","Original Source: https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xw/wjbxw/202407/t20240729_11462515.html\n","---\n"," FULL RECORD:\n","Name: Special Representative of the Chinese Government on African Affairs Liu Yuxi Visits Sao Tome and Principe\n","Year: 2024\n","Level: None\n","Text: Special Representative of the Chinese Government on African Affairs Liu Yuxi Visits Sao Tome and Principe_Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of ChinaIPCVisasEnglishEN简体中文FrançaisРусскийEspañolعربيMinistry of Foreign AffairsThe People’s Republic of ChinaThe MinistryMain ResponsibilitiesThe MinisterPrincipal OfficialsDepartmentsRelated AgenciesNewsTop StoriesSpeechesDiplomatic ScheduleNew AmbassadorsMFA NewsSpokesperson’s RemarksNews from Overseas MissionsResourcesCommuniquésForeign PoliciesIn FocusDiplomatic HistoryDiplomatic FiguresProtocol AffairsOverseas MissionsChinese EmbassiesChinese Consulates GeneralChinese Missions to International Organizations and Representative Offices AbroadCountries and RegionsAsiaAfricaEuropeNorth AmericaSouth AmericaOceaniaABOUT CHINAHOMETHE MINISTRYMain ResponsibilitiesThe MinisterPrincipal OfficialsDepartmentsRelated AgenciesNEWSTop StoriesSpeechesDiplomatic ScheduleNew AmbassadorsMFA NewsSpokesperson’s RemarksNews from Overseas MissionsRESOURCESCommuniquésForeign PoliciesIn FocusDiplomatic HistoryDiplomatic FiguresProtocol AffairsOVERSEAS MISSIONSChinese EmbassiesChinese Consulates GeneralChinese Missions to International Organizations and Representative Offices AbroadCOUNTRIES AND REGIONSAsiaAfricaEuropeNorth AmericaSouth AmericaOceaniaABOUT CHINAHomeNewsMFA NewsSpecial Representative of the Chinese Government on African Affairs Liu Yuxi Visits Sao Tome and PrincipeUpdated:July 29, 2024 17:55On July 26, 2024, Special Representative of the Chinese Government on African Affairs and Ambassador for the Affairs of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) Liu Yuxi visited Sao Tome and Principe, during which he successively met with Foreign Minister Gareth Haddad Guadalupe and Economy Minister Disney Ramos of Sao Tome and Principe.

Aid of Selfishness: The Egoistic MotivationII. Aid of Arrogance: The Act of InterventionismIII. Aid of Hypocrisy: The Truth of the Empty ChequesIV. Aid of Ugliness: The Hegemonic EssenceConclusionIntroductionThe United States has always prided itself as the world’s largest foreign aid donor. However, in fact, U.S. foreign aid has always taken maximizing the interests of the U.S. as its fundamental starting and ending point, while ignoring the practical interests and long-term development of recipient developing countries. Being selfish, arrogant, hypocritical and ugly, and wantonly interfering in other countries’ internal affairs for its own benefits, U.S. foreign aid brings about seriously negative impacts on world peace and development.Based on facts and data, by presenting the motivation, behaviors, effects and impacts of U.S. foreign aid, this report exposes the hypocritical nature and baneful influence of U.S. foreign aid, and amply validates the ugly intentions and serious harm of U.S. acting arbitrarily in the name of aid, upholding the unipolar hegemony, disrupting the international development order, and undermining global prosperity and stability.I. Aid of Selfishness: The Egoistic Motivation◆In 1949, then U.S. President Truman put forward the Point Four Program of economic and technical assistance for the underdeveloped areas in Asia, Africa and Latin America, which marked the beginning of U.S. foreign aid to developing countries.◆Throughout the past 70 years, the primary goal of U.S. foreign aid has always been to serve its own interests and safeguard its own security. Goals such as promoting global poverty alleviation and development have always given way to U.S. strategic goals, which disguise the real intention of U.S. aid. U.S. political scientist Hans Morgenthau, the father of the realist theory of international relations, pointed out that “foreign aid is no different from diplomatic or military policy or propaganda. They are all weapons in the political armory of the nation.” In 1966, U.S. international relations expert David Baldwin publishedForeign Aid and American Foreign Policy,which clearly pointed out that “…foreign aid is first and foremost a technique of statecraft. It is, in other words, a means by which one nation tries to get other nations to act in desired ways.”◆Historically, U.S. foreign aid has been driven by realist theories of its own national interests, with the starting point and ultimate goal being the maximization of national interests. During the cold war, the main goal of U.S. foreign aid was to stop the spread of communism and to consolidate U.S. hegemony. After the 9/11 attack, the goal of U.S. foreign aid shifted to global anti-terrorism to ensure the national security. During the Trump administration, U.S. advocated “America First”, and U.S. foreign aid was deeply influenced by populism and conservatism, ignoring its responsibility as a developed country to narrow the North-South divide and other development issues, withdrawing from the Paris Agreement on climate change and World Health Organization for a time, hastily reducing or even cutting contributions to important multilateral institutions, demanding other countries to shoulder more responsibility. All above mentioned undermines the international development cooperation.◆At present, U.S. not only unabashedly proclaims its self-serving intention to provide foreign aid, but also pushes aid to the main battlefield of great power games. In the U.S. President’s budget requests of the past three years, the foreign aid budget has been rising year by year, focusing on the achievement of U.S. strategic and security objectives. Samantha Power, Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) said, the President’s budget request is a reflection of the critical importance of development and humanitarian assistance in advancing U.S. interests around the world, and the relevant investment will bring huge returns to our national security and our economy. TheJoint Strategic Plan for FY2022-2026issued by the U.S. State Department and USAID proposes five strategic goals, including renewing U.S. leadership, promoting global prosperity and shape an international environment in which the U.S. can thrive, strengthening democratic institutions, upholding universal values, and promoting human dignity, all of which reflect that the primary goal of aid is to safeguard U.S. interests. For the first time in history, the Administrator of USAID has been appointed as a permanent member of the White House National Security Council, underscoring the importance of aid in pursuing the U.S. national security strategy. Former US Defense Secretary James Mattis confessed, “Modern foreign aid is not charity. It is a strategic and an investment in a stronger America abroad.” The article in The Economist hit the point about the work done by USAID: “there was never any pretense of altruism.” Maura O'Neill, a former innovation chief at the agency, said USAID’s goal was to “catalyze more South Koreas and less North Koreas.”◆The egoistic motive has led to the long-term perpetuation of U.S. aid by domestic politics and its global strategy, with a total disregard for the vital interests and actual needs of developing countries. Rama Yade, senior director of Africa Center, Atlantic Council, pointed out that U.S. has traditionally focused on security priorities in its African engagement. The Cold-War vision not only dominates perceptions in the public and private realms, but also distracts from the authentic economic and strategic opportunities the continent offers investors in the 21st century. The impact of the 9/11 attack has strengthened this approach over the past two decades. Most recently, the U.S. has seen Africa as a battleground for competition with China, ignoring that the continent’s nations have their own strategic interests.II. Aid of Arrogance: The Act of Interventionism◆The United States has never treated developing countries as equals, but, gives aid as a preacher and savior in a way that stands aloof and domineers over others, completely in accordance with its own standards and ignoring the cultural traditions and realistic conditions of other countries. Former U.S. President Richard Nixon admitted, “one of the most persistent faults in America’s dealings with the rest of the world has been our tendency to measure all governments by the standards of western democracy and all cultures by the standards of Western Europe.” Gilbert Rist, Swiss scholar and Honorary Professor of the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva (IHEID), took a sharp look at the depravity of U.S. foreign aid in his bookThe History of Development: From Western Origins to the Global Faith.As he put it,the Point Four Program legitimized U.S. hegemony, which in essence is anticolonial neo-imperialism wherein Westernization is regarded as the sole path for the underdeveloped countries to achieve development. This form of aid, founded on a singular standard and characterized by an arrogant self-assuredness, coerces developing nations into fitting a one-size-fits-all mold, pushing them onto someone else's development path, ultimately eroding their sense of identity and economic independence.◆The United States often attaches harsh conditions that undermine the sovereignty and dignity of the recipient countries, and wantonly points fingers at the recipient countries’ internal affairs. Founded in 2004, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is one of the specialized aid agencies in the U.S., known for setting demanding political and economic criteria in selecting aid recipients and providing large-scale, long-cycle “aid package” that compels partner country to carry out the reforms that the U.S. expects. As of 2019, MCC had approved 37 agreements involving 29 countries with a total value of more than $14 billion, according to its disclosures. The articles of such agreements put U.S. law above the law of the recipient country, requiring its partner to meet the standards set by the United States for political reform, market economy, democratization and human rights. This seriously infringes upon the sovereignty of the recipient country and has faced continuous opposition and resistance from developing nations.◆Coveted Sri Lanka’s critical strategic location close to the Indian Ocean's main waterway, the United States attempted to compel the Sri Lanka government into signing a MCC deal, the terms of which totally inconsistent with the laws of Sri Lanka and the local social, political and economic conditions. This was resolutely resisted by the Sri Lanka government. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Sri Lanka President by then, said in November 2020 his government would never sign the agreement with the United States “even in dream.” On February 27, 2022, under duress by the U.S., Nepal's parliament approved the implementation of the Millennium Challenge Plan agreement signed between Nepal and the U.S. in 2017. The signing triggered domestic confrontations within Nepal, leading to social unrest. The United States not only set a deadline for the signing, but also made it clear that if the agreement was not signed before such deadline, it would terminate its cooperation and reevaluate its relations with Nepal. This agreement also includes clause that infringe upon the sovereignty of Nepal, explicitly stipulating that the agreement, once implemented, will take precedence over local laws, and that the U.S. personnel will not be subject to Nepal legal jurisdiction, etc.◆The United States is good at using aid as a bargaining chip and using “carrot and stick” to force developing countries to do what they say, which results in a serious lack of coherence in its aid policy and undermines the sustainable development of recipient countries. During the Trump administration, the U.S. has repeatedly suspended or reassessed aid to El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, the Solomon Islands, among others, as a political threat. In August 2018, the United States, as the primary donor, stopped contributing to its long-funded UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and described the organization’s work as “irredeemably flawed”. This sudden halt was condemned by the United Nations and other parties. As a result, the agency once fell into a serious financial crisis, unable to work around the Palestinian refugee issue, had to scale back services and lay off workers. This move was reported to have aim at pressuring Palestine into accepting the U.S.’s so-called “deal of the century”.◆The United States, in the name of aid for a long time, has infiltrated recipient countries in various ways, imposed American values and the “democratic model” on others, and force other countries to carry out “democratic transformation”, which has greatly harmed developing countries. Yet under such interference, the recipient countries have not only failed to alleviate poverty, but also suffered from numerous internal conflicts, with the deterioration of the situation leading to long-term dependence on aid or even economic collapse, wars and conflicts, and loss of life. Thomas Dichter, former Peace Corp member and country director who has worked in more than 60 developing countries for 50 years pointed out in his article published atForeign Service Journal,it is commonly criticized that if the key variables for development, including cultural, social and political realms, are not present, aid will not only be ineffective but also create dependency.◆The United States ignored the recipient countries’ condition and development needs but instead forces marketization and privatization in the name of aid. In the 1970s to the 1980s, U.S. aid to developing countries was based on the premise that recipient countries would undergo marketization and privatization structural adjustments to achieve economic goals. The USAID has publicly formulated a policy in this regard, requiring recipient countries to use aid mainly for the development of private enterprises and not for public investment. Such unilateral aid by the United States was difficult to acclimatize with the local circumstances and affected the ecology and endogenous driving force of sustainable economic development of recipient countries and increased their debt burden. Against this pressure, developing countries called for equal development rights.◆After the end of the Cold War, the United States launched large-scale aid program to countries in Eastern Europe and Latin America, and promoted the Washington Consensus centered on neoliberalism, democratization and shock therapy. Large numbers of U.S. consultants and contractors went to these countries to “guide” market-oriented reforms. However, the US-backed shock therapy has brought disastrous consequences for Russia and other countries, with tens of millions of people falling into poverty, a widening gap between rich and poor, and economy collapsing.◆During the 20 years of invasion in Afghanistan, successive US administrations spared no effort to implant “democracy and a free market economy” in Afghanistan. Statistics shows the United States spent more than $2 trillion in the 20-year war while its official development assistance to Afghanistan amounted to $32.4 billion. The United States is “transforming” Afghanistan with aid while smashing it with artillery. In 2021 the U.S. army hastily withdrew from Afghanistan, declaring the complete failure of its “democratic transformation plan”, leaving the country devastated. More than 174,000 Afghanistan people, including more than 30,000 civilians, have been killed in the war, millions of civilians are struggling to survive, 3 million children are out of school due to poverty and 18.9 million people face severe food shortages. The United States not only ignored the horrors of the war, but also openly stole about $9.5 billion in Afghan national assets, further exacerbating the humanitarian disaster for the country.III. Aid of Hypocrisy: The Truth of Empty Cheques◆The U.S. has repeatedly boasted its “contribution” as the world’s largest aid donor, but it has never fully met its international responsibilities. In 1970, developed countries agreed to give 0.7 percent of gross national income (GNI) for official development assistance (ODA). However, according to OECD, the U.S. has never fulfilled this commitment on records. Since the 1990s, the U.S. has provided only 0.1 to 0.2 percent of its ODA/GNI, which is far below the 0.7 percent commitment. In 2011, the United Nations adopted the Istanbul Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries, in which developed countries committed to allocate 0.15% to 0.2% of their GNI for assistance to the least developed countries. The United States has never fulfilled this obligation, with its assistance to the least developed countries consistently remaining below 0.1% of its GNI.◆Aid for climate change is a typical case of the U.S. only paying lip service. At the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference held as early as 2009, developed countries, including the United States, pledged to provide at least $100 billion in climate aid annually to developing countries until 2020. However, this commitment has yet to be fulfilled, and even the deadline for funding has been postponed to 2023. Among major developed country emitters, the U.S. is the first to break its promise and behaves the worst. Carbon Brief, a UK energy research organization, shows that the U.S. should provide $39.9 billion in climate aid each year according to the share of historical carbon emissions, but in 2020 it only provided $7.6 billion, accounting for only 19% of its responsible share estimated, and contributing the least among the 23 developed countries concerned. In 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden pledged $11.4 billion annually  in climate aid to developing countries, but in reality, the U.S. has secured just $1 billion in 2021 and 2022 towards that goal. The United States has taken the lead in dodging the compensation issue that developing countries have repeatedly raised.The Washington Postcommented that the U.S. has long resisted financial commitments at UN climate talks, fearing legal liability for the trillions of dollars of damage. Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at Climate Action Network International, criticized that “the U.S. has no sympathy, has no empathy. People are dying, and they don't want a system here to help them.”◆In recent years, the U.S. has launched a wide range of initiatives containing aid content, such as theBlue Dot Network,Build Back Better World, Prosper Africa, Power Africa,etc. The essence of these bombast initiatives is indeed “repetitive packaging”, “watering down”, and “making up numbers” to fool the world, with very few projects on the ground, and ultimately ending up in a situation of loud thunder but little rain.◆In June 2021, the U.S. led in launchingThe Build Back Better World (B3W)infrastructure initiative, which was packaged asThe Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII)at the G7 Summit in 2022. An article from Foreign Affairs shows that, since its launch, B3W has stagnated, with the total amount of announced projects amounting to a paltry $6 million, a far cry from the billions of dollars promised by the U.S. government. The U.S. proposed the initiative with more political than economic intentions, not out of concern for the infrastructure development needs of developing countries, but as a political show.◆U.S. aid to Africa has just been the “pie in the sky” talk. In June 2013, then President Barack Obama visited South Africa and announced Power Africa initiative, claiming that this initiative will light up parts of the continent that are still in darkness. Yet as of December 2020, the actual power generation capacity ofPower Africais less than a quarter of what it has promised. At the first US-Africa Leaders Summit in 2014, the Obama administration made promises such as providing funds for AIDS prevention and treatment, but after Donald Trump took office, the U.S. government drastically cut the aid. Emmanuel Matambo，scholar from University of Johannesburg in South Africa, pointed out that the summit failed to show African countries tangible results. As the 2nd U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit took place in December 2022, the U.S. has committed $55 billion to support the AU Agenda 2063, but only $15 billion of that amount is newly signed projects, while the remaining $40 billion is a repackaging of various U.S. initiatives and agreements with Africa in recent years. According to Amaka Anku, Head of Africa’s Practice at Eurasia Group, Biden’s rhetoric has been all great and pretty, but it’s hollow. “They're not really doing things differently.”◆U.S. aid performance and quality have always been poor, with inefficiency, waste, redundancy, and profit repatriation that was recognized as “American characteristics”. USAID is widely rated by developing countries as the organization they are least willing to cooperate with. In order to get U.S. aid, recipients have to go through lengthy and complicated procedures, read over 2,000 pages of procurement terms and conditions, and go through endless approvals and reviews. However, most of the funds obtained from the aid flow back to the U.S. itself. USAID has openly admitted that about 80% of its expenditures were spent in the U.S.. Behind the world's largest donor, there are filled with high management fees, hidden corruption and profit-making, the lavish spending of American contractors. U.S. consultants live in the most luxurious hotels in poor countries and enjoy sumptuous Western cuisine. As early as the 1990s, issues of corruption and the survival of USAID had sparked heated controversy in U.S. political and academic circles, and between 1995 and 2000, the agency's workforce was cut by 30 percent.◆The Center for Global Development (CGD), a U.S. think-tank, publishes theCommitment to Development Index (CDI)report every year to assess the assistance of the world's richest countries to poorer countries, and the U.S. has been ranked at the bottom of the list in all previous years’ reports. Reports show that U.S. not only falls far short of the 0.7 percent aid target, but also performs poorly in four areas: effectiveness of bilateral aid, transparency, reducing the burden on recipient governments, and setting up institutions in recipient countries. Ian Mitchell, a senior policy fellow and co-director of the Europe programme at the CGD said this was the result of a long history of U.S. policy positions. In 2021, the U.S. ranked the worst in terms of aid spending, providing only 0.13 percent of its GNI for international development financing, compared to an average of 0.29 percent for the assessed countries. The United States ranked third from the bottom globally in terms of aid quality and performs particularly poorly in terms of recipient country ownership and aid localization.◆During the period of COVID-19, the United States has been self-proclaimed as the world’s largest donor of vaccine, but in reality it has been a huge obstacle to the global fight against the pandemic. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), a US health research organization, the U.S. pledged to donate at least 1.1 billion doses of coronavirus vaccine to the world by 2023, but it was not until January 2023 that the U.S. fulfilled 665 million doses. The United States’ massive stockpiling of medical supplies and vaccines has led to a continuing strain on the global supply of vaccines, resulting in a serious imbalance in their distribution around the globe. According toHarvard Political Review,the U.S. is one of the world's leading practitioners of vaccine nationalism. The U.S. has used expiring vaccines to fulfill aid promises, causing African countries to reject further U.S. aid, deploring the egregious behavior of the U.S.. In 2022, 191,000 expiring AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines were rejected by South Africa and redistributed to South Sudan, where they arrived only two weeks before their expiration date, resulting in the destruction of about 59,000 vaccines. In addition, the Trump administration's announcement of its withdrawal from WHO in July 2020 severely undermined global synergies against the epidemic at a critical time when the global fight against the COVID-19.IV. Aid of Ugliness: The Hegemonic Essence◆U.S. foreign aid is essentially one of the tools to maintain its hegemonic position. In the name of foreign aid, the United States greedily “sucks blood” from developing countries and feeds back U.S. financial hegemony, food hegemony, military hegemony and cultural hegemony. The hegemony of the United States cannot be separated from its plundering of developing countries.◆The U.S. has skillfully used aid instruments to tie developing countries firmly to its dominant financial system, transferring risks and responsibilities and exacerbating the Matthew effect (winner-takes-all). In November 2022, the Development Assistance Committee of OECD issued a peer review of U.S. official development assistance, which pointed out that the relevant policies and regulations of the United States have had negative spillover effects on developing countries, which the United States has failed to mitigate with appropriate tools and measures. According to theGlobal Financial Stability Reportreleased by the IMF in April 2023, U.S. financial policies have become the biggest challenge to global financial stability. The aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve since last year have substantially pushed up global financing costs and aggravated the disorderly flow of international capital, which has not only led to the bankruptcy or takeover of some banks in the United States and Europe, but also aggravated the difficulties of emerging markets and developing countries. Heavily indebted countries have even fallen into a vicious cycle of debt servicing. The UN Secretary-General António Guterres has criticized the current global financial system not only fails to promote the development of the least developed countries, but also exacerbates the global wealth inequality through predatory borrowing costs, which has led to the deep indebtedness of the least developed countries. It is worth pointing out that the United States not only keeps its mouth shut about the fact that it is western commercial creditors and multilateral institutions that are the largest creditors of developing countries, but also increases the debt burden of developing countries through continued money printing and interest rate hikes. In an article entitle “U.S. deliberately manipulates the truth about African debt”,the Heraldof Zimbabwe pointed out that “the so called African ‘debt trap’ has long been touted by both Democrats and Republicans, and more importantly, it has been further advanced by value-laden U.S. corporations and agencies, including media outlets.”◆The United States touts itself as the world's largest food aid donor, but in fact it is the “initiator” of the global food crisis. Three of the four major grain monopolies in the global grain market today are U.S. enterprises, which not only manipulate international grain prices, repeatedly speculate on food security issues and seek huge profits, but also create food dependency of developing countries under the manipulation of the U.S. government and monopoly capital. Mexico, Argentina and other large traditional agricultural countries have gradually lost their ability for food self-sufficiency, and the lifeblood of national food security has been manipulated in the hands of the United States. The United States has also imposed a food embargo on “disobedient” countries. Since the 1950s, the United States has launched eight food embargoes, which have greatly undermined global food security.◆U.S. foreign aid has long been linked with the interests of arms dealers, and has become a cover for United States military hegemony. The United States not only make war profits through humanitarian crises, but also add fuel to the fire through aid projects. Alex Lo, a columnist fortheSouth China Morning Post, pointed out that in the 20th century, the United States used a large amount of money to foster pro-American regimes in many developing countries. Today, from Ukraine, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria to Pakistan, Yemen, the intervention of U.S. foreign aid has everything to do with the humanitarian crisis facing these countries.U.S. foreign aid has prolonged the crisis in the Ukraine. As of January 2023, the U.S. commitment to Ukraine amounted to $76.8 billion, of which military aid accounted for the largest share, $46.5 billion, or 61%. U.S. media revealed that 40% of U.S. military aid to Ukraine is used for the mandatory purchase of U.S. equipment and training services, known as “tied aid”. Part of the military aid is a financial loan that will become a long-term liability for Ukraine. Marjorie Taylor Greene, member of the U.S. House of Representatives, stated bluntly, the United States aid to Ukraine is tantamount to disguised “money laundering”. In addition, the U.S. media and Russian officials have disclosed that weapons aided by the U.S. flows into the black market, posing a threat to international and regional security.◆The United States, under the banner of aid, has long acted recklessly, instigating color revolutions, provoking regional conflicts and subverting national regimes, and has been the creator and instigator of chaos and war in the world, bringing serious harm to the international community and great disaster to the people of the world.The United States has attempted to transform other countries and shape the world order in accordance with its values and political system, promoting the so-called “democracy” in many countries under the cover of human rights groups, professional associations, labor organizations and independent think tanks, fostering opposition politicians and pro-American forces, and subverting and infiltrating legitimate regimes. Behind the Arab Spring, the Rose Revolution in Georgia, the Orange Revolution in Ukraine and the Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan, the United States has financed, instigated and even directly intervened.The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) is an U.S. NGO that openly engages in the export of democracy activities, with 97% of its funding coming from the U.S. government, and its mission is to foster pro-U.S. opposition, labor unions and the media around the globe. Allen Weinstein, the NED co-founder, in a 1991 interview with The Washington Post, stated “a lot of what we do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA.” In times of peace, the so-called NGOs funded by the United States carry out “peaceful evolution” bit by bit through ideological infiltration and personnel training, and then directly jump out to participate in and instigate protests in times of crisis, acting as the “vanguard” of color revolutions.While the United States is fighting terrorism globally, it is also fostering terrorists to achieve its own geostrategic intentions. In October 2016, WikiLeaks released documents showing that the United States has provided various assistance to al-Qaeda and the Islamic State in order to overthrow the Gaddafi regime in Libya and the government of Syria, and has instigated the terrorist groups to carry out military operations to topple the Syrian government. Graham Fuller, a Middle East expert and former CIA analyst, said that “the United States is one of the key creators of the Islamic State.”◆The United States uses aid as a tool of geopolitical games to maliciously suppress the influence of other countries and enhance U.S. leadership. In fiscal year 2021, the U.S. government's budget bill invested US $300 million and US $290 million to set up the Countering Chinese Influence Fund and the Countering Russian Influence Fund respectively.Congressional Budget Justification: Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs, Fiscal Year 2023,clearly states that foreign aid is a key tool for strategic competition. The State Council and USAID will use the Countering Chinese Influence Fund and Countering Russian Influence Fund to support the programs.ConclusionDevelopment is the eternal pursuit of human society. Foreign aid should have been an important resource for addressing global development challenges, should have been used to help the people of developing countries to solve their survival and development challenges, should have promoted the implementation of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and should have contributed to world peace, prosperity and stability. However, U.S. regards foreign aid as a tool to maintain its hegemonic position and to engage in geopolitical games. In the name of aid, U.S. has acted recklessly, committed numerous misdeeds and committed numerous crimes. The hypocritical nature of U.S. has been clearly revealed, which has brought about a deep disaster to the world.Although the U.S. itself has a lot of problems with foreign aid, U.S. keep putting a label on China's foreign aid and pouring dirty water on it. It should be emphasized that non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, non-imposition on others and non-attachment of any political conditions are the “iron principles” of China’s aid. The gold standard for self-evaluation of China’s aid is whether the people of the partner country support, whether the economic and social development of the partner country has developed, and whether the international community is satisfied. Putting righteousness first, advocating amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness are the unchanging values of China’s foreign aid. “Giving roses to others will leave a lingering fragrance while trying to gain through cunning and violence will only leave a lasting stench”. Draped in the cloak of aid, engaging in hegemony, arrogance, and bullying, will ultimately backfire and harm the U.S. itself, and will inevitably be met with the condemnation of people around the world. To engage in hegemony and bullying under the guise of “aid” will ultimately be detrimental to others, and will inevitably backfire on itself, and will be spurned by the people of the world.Links:State CouncilMinistry of CommerceNational Development and Reform CommissionNational Immigration AdministrationCopyright©www.fmprc.gov.cnAddress: 2 Chaoyangmen Nandajie, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100701Tel: 86 - 10 - 65961114\n","Country: United States\n","Continent: America\n","Developed country: 1\n","Developing country: 0\n","Communist country: 0\n","Original Source: https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xw/wjbxw/202405/t20240530_11344003.html\n","---\n"," FULL RECORD:\n","Name: Special Envoy Zhai Jun of the Chinese Government on the Middle East Issue Meets with French Ambassador to China Bertrand Lortholary\n","Year: 2024\n","Level: None\n","Text: Special Envoy Zhai Jun of the Chinese Government on the Middle East Issue Meets with French Ambassador to China Bertrand Lortholary_Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of ChinaIPCVisasEnglishEN简体中文FrançaisРусскийEspañolعربيMinistry of Foreign AffairsThe People’s Republic of ChinaThe MinistryMain ResponsibilitiesThe MinisterPrincipal OfficialsDepartmentsRelated AgenciesNewsTop StoriesSpeechesDiplomatic ScheduleNew AmbassadorsMFA NewsSpokesperson’s RemarksNews from Overseas MissionsResourcesCommuniquésForeign PoliciesIn FocusDiplomatic HistoryDiplomatic FiguresProtocol AffairsOverseas MissionsChinese EmbassiesChinese Consulates GeneralChinese Missions to International Organizations and Representative Offices AbroadCountries and RegionsAsiaAfricaEuropeNorth AmericaSouth AmericaOceaniaABOUT CHINAHOMETHE MINISTRYMain ResponsibilitiesThe MinisterPrincipal OfficialsDepartmentsRelated AgenciesNEWSTop StoriesSpeechesDiplomatic ScheduleNew AmbassadorsMFA NewsSpokesperson’s RemarksNews from Overseas MissionsRESOURCESCommuniquésForeign PoliciesIn FocusDiplomatic HistoryDiplomatic FiguresProtocol AffairsOVERSEAS MISSIONSChinese EmbassiesChinese Consulates GeneralChinese Missions to International Organizations and Representative Offices AbroadCOUNTRIES AND REGIONSAsiaAfricaEuropeNorth AmericaSouth AmericaOceaniaABOUT CHINAHomeNewsMFA NewsSpecial Envoy Zhai Jun of the Chinese Government on the Middle East Issue Meets with French Ambassador to China Bertrand LortholaryUpdated:April 18, 2024 21:45On April 18, 2024, Special Envoy Zhai Jun of the Chinese Government on the Middle East Issue met with French Ambassador to China Bertrand Lortholary at the latter's request.

Lazaro, and lodged serious representations to the Philippines on its illegal resupply to the military vessel illegally grounded at Ren'ai Jiao and other issues.Chen Xiaodong noted that without permission from the Chinese government, a civilian ship and two Coast Guard vessels of the Philippines intruded into the adjacent waters of Ren'ai Jiao of China's Nansha Qundao on March 23, in an attempt to send materials, including construction materials, to the military vessel illegally grounded at Ren'ai Jiao to build a permanent military outpost so as to achieve long-term and illegal occupation. This is a serious violation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, a serious breach of the commitments made by the Philippine side, a serious infringement of China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, and an undermining of peace and stability in the region. China firmly opposes this. China has indisputable sovereignty over Nansha Qundao and its adjacent waters, including Ren'ai Jiao. The Philippine side has repeatedly gone back on its word and provoked incidents regarding Ren'ai Jiao, which is the fundamental reason for the repeated escalation of the situation on the ground. China once again urges the Philippines to honor its commitments, abide by the consensus, stop making infringements and provocations at sea, refrain from any unilateral actions that may complicate the situation, and earnestly return to the right track of dialogue and consultation with China to properly handle disputes. China will continue to take necessary measures in accordance with domestic and international law to firmly safeguard national territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests.Chen Xiaodong expressed China's solemn position on the Philippines' push for the legislation of the \"Maritime Zones Act\" and its infringement and provocation on Huangyan Dao and Tiexian Jiao. Chen Xiaodong noted that the Philippines is trying to invoke the illegal award of the South China Sea Arbitration to incorporate China's Huangyan Dao and most of the islands and reefs of the Nansha Qundao and related waters into the Philippine maritime zones in the form of legislation. This is bound to seriously infringe on China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea, escalate and expand the maritime disputes between the two countries, and jeopardize peace and stability in the South China Sea and the larger interest of bilateral relations. China has indisputable sovereignty over Huangyan Dao, Nansha Qundao, including Tiexian Jiao, and their adjacent waters. The Philippine side, in disregard of China's repeated dissuasion, has frequently sent military, police and official vessels and aircraft to intrude into adjacent waters and airspace of Huangyan Dao, and has repeatedly and illegally landed on Tiexian Jiao, infringing upon China's territorial sovereignty and violating the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea. China once again strongly urges the Philippine side to immediately stop the legislative process that undermines China's sovereignty and to immediately stop its maritime infringement and provocation.Chen Xiaodong emphasized that the relations between China and the Philippines are now at a crossroads where bilateral relations would go from where, and that the Philippine side must act prudently. China once again demands that the Philippine side take China's concerns seriously, stop its wrongdoing before it is too late, and return to the right track of properly handling disputes through negotiation and consultation with China as soon as possible, so as to maintain the larger interest of bilateral relations and the peace and stability of the South China Sea with China.Links:State CouncilMinistry of CommerceNational Development and Reform CommissionNational Immigration AdministrationCopyright©www.fmprc.gov.cnAddress: 2 Chaoyangmen Nandajie, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100701Tel: 86 - 10 - 65961114\n","Country: Philippines\n","Continent: Asia\n","Developed country: 0\n","Developing country: 1\n","Communist country: 0\n","Original Source: https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xw/wjbxw/202405/t20240530_11343970.html\n","---\n"," FULL RECORD:\n","Name: Vice Foreign Minister Deng Li and Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Türkiye Burak Akçapar Hold Political Consultations between the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of China and Türkiye\n","Year: 2024\n","Level: None\n","Text: Vice Foreign Minister Deng Li and Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Türkiye Burak Akçapar Hold Political Consultations between the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of China and Türkiye_Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of ChinaIPCVisasEnglishEN简体中文FrançaisРусскийEspañolعربيMinistry of Foreign AffairsThe People’s Republic of ChinaThe MinistryMain ResponsibilitiesThe MinisterPrincipal OfficialsDepartmentsRelated AgenciesNewsTop StoriesSpeechesDiplomatic ScheduleNew AmbassadorsMFA NewsSpokesperson’s RemarksNews from Overseas MissionsResourcesCommuniquésForeign PoliciesIn FocusDiplomatic HistoryDiplomatic FiguresProtocol AffairsOverseas MissionsChinese EmbassiesChinese Consulates GeneralChinese Missions to International Organizations and Representative Offices AbroadCountries and RegionsAsiaAfricaEuropeNorth AmericaSouth AmericaOceaniaABOUT CHINAHOMETHE MINISTRYMain ResponsibilitiesThe MinisterPrincipal OfficialsDepartmentsRelated AgenciesNEWSTop StoriesSpeechesDiplomatic ScheduleNew AmbassadorsMFA NewsSpokesperson’s RemarksNews from Overseas MissionsRESOURCESCommuniquésForeign PoliciesIn FocusDiplomatic HistoryDiplomatic FiguresProtocol AffairsOVERSEAS MISSIONSChinese EmbassiesChinese Consulates GeneralChinese Missions to International Organizations and Representative Offices AbroadCOUNTRIES AND REGIONSAsiaAfricaEuropeNorth AmericaSouth AmericaOceaniaABOUT CHINAHomeNewsMFA NewsVice Foreign Minister Deng Li and Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Türkiye Burak Akçapar Hold Political Consultations between the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of China and TürkiyeUpdated:March 24, 2024 20:39On March 22, 2024, Vice Foreign Minister Deng Li and Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Türkiye Burak Akçapar held political consultations between the ministries of foreign affairs of China and Türkiye in Beijing.Deng Li said that China and Türkiye are both major developing countries and emerging markets sharing extensive common interests.

In the international arena, the United States is daydreaming about continuing to speak for all, obstructing the democratization of international relations with hegemonic practices, destroying international public opinion environment with smear campaigns, and deluding the international community with self-glorified images and high-sounding rhetoric.This report, by presenting numerous facts, aims to expose what  “free speech” is according to the United States, what the US actually does, and what its real purpose is.I. Freedom of Speech in the United States is not worthy of the name◆The United States regards freedom of speech as the foundation of the country, but treads on it under the feet of political reality. Although the First Amendment to the US Constitution explicitly stipulates \"freedom of speech,\" political disputes and group interests have been constantly taking advantage of the form of \"freedom of speech\" to damage its essence. The public do not feel free to speak truthfully, and gradually see through and get tired of politicians' hypocritical slogans and promises.◆The Knight Foundation of the United States released its Free Speech in America After 2020 survey report in 2022, which was rated as \"representing the most comprehensive public opinion study on free speech at present\" by the US Free Speech Center. The report noted that political polarization and party strife have severely undermined free speech in the United States, especially on political issues.◆The freedom of speech in the United States has fallen in recent years. In a 2022 national poll conducted byThe New York Timesand Siena College, 66% of participants say they do not believe that Americans enjoy free speech. 8% also say Americans don't have any freedom of speech. In recent years, due to political polarization and political violence, people have become more cautious or even reticent when talking about political topics, fearing attacks and reprisals. 46% said that American society is far less free to talk about politics compared with a decade ago. Many people talk about as little as possible or even evade political topics. Women are more cautious than men, and younger people more cautious than older ones. Some young people have been severely criticized and even retaliated against for certain political remarks.◆Restrictions on free speech are quite common across the United States. Most states have bad performance on respecting free speech and the right to assembly, according to the 2022 US State Free Speech Index report by the Free Speech Institute. Only three states - Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa - scored more than 70%, and 35 states scored less than 50%.◆The United States is flooded with false information, which further erodes its credibility in terms of free speech. During the 2016 presidential election, political groups used media to spread disinformation to interfere in elections, with fake news websites receiving as much as 159 million visits, equivalent to 0.64 visits per American adult, according to a research study conducted by Stanford University. The Brookings Institution's report, Disinformation is Eroding Public Confidence in Democrac released in 2022, noted that minorities are more susceptible to disinformation, and 51.5 percent of respondents believe that the black American community is the target. In recent years, discussion of election fraud and spread of disinformation have further reduced American confidence in free speech.II. The United States violates freedom of speech at home◆Political fights trample on freedom of speech. It is not a secret that the US government monitors domestic public opinion. Carl Bernstein, a well-known journalist who exposed the 1972 Watergate scandal, revealed in detail the collusion between CIA and the press.The New York Times, Time Weekly, CBSand other media have close ties and cooperate with CIA to monitor public opinion.◆False information is used to manipulate public opinion and interfere with speech. The Cato Institute report noted that \"if American people expect the media to provide accurate and neutral information on government policy, it will be a big mistake.\" The US government colludes with media and often disseminates various information under the cover of media, in order to achieve political objectives. In March 2022,The New York Timespublished an editorial titled There is a Freedom of Speech Problem in America, pointing out that the US society is caught in a cycle of left and right attacking each other and that freedom of speech in the US is a thing of the past. In April 2022, the Biden administration announced the establishment of a committee aimed at combating disinformation about population and infrastructure in the US, which met with fierce opposition from Republican members in the U.S. Congress and the right-wing media. Republican lawmakers claimed that the administration is using taxpayer’s money to suppress free speech in the conservative news media under the guise of cracking down on disinformation. The Committee was shut down after only three weeks in existence due to objections from the US House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Freedom of speech in the United States today is more like a ball kicked about by the parties than a right in the hands of people.◆The US government manipulates epidemic information and suppresses truth-telling voices. Helen Zhu, a female doctor of Chinese descent who warned about the epidemic in the United States and reported the test results, was given a gag order by the administration. Captain Crozier, who told the truth about the epidemic on the aircraft carrier USS Roosevelt, was sacked. Some officials in the State Department and Defense Department, who dared to speak the truth, have all been laid off. Fauci, an infectious disease expert known as the US \"anti-epidemic captain,\" has \"disappeared\" many times.◆Freedom of speech in the United States has a problem of racial discrimination. The perception of free speech among white groups is significantly stronger than black groups where freedom of speech is more restricted. Tracing back the U.S. history, freedom of speech has never been fully and equally applied to the black community, and state governments have used discretion to suppress rights of the black community for a long time. The black community is often treated differently when it comes to free speech. In June 2023，Justice Earls—the only African American woman justice on North Carolina’s Supreme Court—was investigated by the North Carolina Judicial Standards Commission after she disclosed in an interview that there was a lack of racial and gender diversity in the local judicial system and she was treated differently by her colleagues on account of race and gender. In February of 2024, Margaret Satterthwaite,the UN Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers,commented that the commission’s disciplinary investigations of the only African American woman justice in the state raised suspicions of racial and gender discrimination.◆US government has been cracking down on TikTok. Before the House Energy and Commerce Committee held the TikTok hearing in March 2023, several US free speech organizations, including the Civil Liberties Union, the Center for Democracy and Technology, and the Coalition Against Censorship, jointly signed an open letter. It pointed out that the ban on TikTok would have a serious impact on free speech in digital domain, which violated the rights of American people according to the First Amendment. The crackdown has set a worrying precedent by damaging freedom of more than 150 million TikTok American users on the platform. The US government has turned a deaf ear to these calls and is determined to clamp down on TikTok.◆Press intervention threatens free speech. In recent years, freedom of the press in the United States has been significantly impacted, and working environment for journalists has deteriorated.CNNcorrespondent Jim Acosta has been stripped of his White House press credentials for asking about \"caravan migrants\" and \"access to Russia\" during a White House press briefing. Some senior government officials have also threatened and attacked news media members.The Washington Post, New York Timesand other media pointed out that these words and deeds had increased journalists` security risks and severely impacted press freedom. The United States government also restricts the coverage of news events by media. In 2021, a number of journalists were harassed or harmed by police while reporting on popular protests against the police killings of George Floyd and Dawn Wright. According to the US Freedom of the Press Tracker, there were 128 incidents of press freedom violations across the US in 2022, including 40 attacks on journalists and 15 arrests or prosecutions. In 2023, at least 12 journalists in the United States were arrested or charged, and several were criminally convicted for normal news reporting.◆Campus Control suppresses freedom of speech. In recent years, various bans on words and books in the United States have seriously interfered with freedom of speech on campus. Censorship of banned books in public schools has expanded rapidly since 2021, and lawmakers in some states have introduced \"educational gag orders.\" Between January 2021 and February 2022, Republican lawmakers introduced more than 150 state-level laws that restrict teachers from discussing issues like race and social justice in the classroom and also censor and track teachers` speech. In 2022, the Individual Rights and Expression Foundation surveyed nearly 45,000 undergraduates from 208 universities, and found that 22% of students felt they were often unable to speak out on certain issues. Race, gun control, the coronavirus pandemic, anti-discrimination actions and abortion have all become minefields for discussion and expression. Alliance Defending Freedom holds the belief that public schools in the United states are currently suppressing freedom of speech by establishing \"free speech zone\", using vague and misleading policies, forcing teachers and students to express certain information, and punishing faculty members who fail to \"behave well\" in terms of free speech.◆Social media infringes on freedom of speech. Interest groups have lobbied governments and media companies to regulate social media and suppress unfavorable speech. Internal documents released by Twitter show that US Biotech Innovation Group sent letters to the US government and Twitter on behalf of pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer, Modena, AstraZeneca and others, demanding to review users who have called on Twitter to offer low-priced vaccines and share intellectual property and patents in order to maintain their monopoly on COVID-19 vaccines. The US media have reported that financial tycoon George Soros used hundreds of millions of dollars to bribe hundreds of networks related to the US media between 2016 and 2020 to build his own media network and thus achieve public opinion manipulation.◆Social media and the interest groups it represented block free speech.The New York Postreported on March 30, 2023, that Twitter removed nearly 5,000 tweets about \"transgender protests\" outside the US Supreme Court, citing \"incitement to violence.\" As more and more users expressed doubts about deleting tweets, Twitter changed its excuse, saying the deletion was due to the system's automated identification and deletion process without considering the specific content of the tweet. More shockingly, Twitter instead suspendedThe Washington Post's Twitter account after it reported massive deletion of tweets on its Twitter account.The New York Postcommented Twitter's move to banThe Washington Postis \"seriously inconsistent with its declared free speech.\"III. The United States manipulates freedom of speech in foreign countries◆To maintain its hegemony, the United States often manipulates international public opinion, adding \"rationality\" and \"moral sense\" to its foreign policy. The United States also uses social media to launch psychological warfare, along with military operations in other countries, and suppress all kinds of anti-war rhetoric. It uses freedom of speech to practice double standards, creates a smokescreen and claims that other countries are spreading \"false information,\" while it publishes various distorted and discrediting reports based on false information, to divert the attention of the international community from misdeeds of the United States. On May 4, 2022, U.S. Senator Rand Paul spoke bluntly at a Senate hearing, “Do you know who the greatest propagator of disinformation in the history of the world is? The U.S. government.”◆During the Cold War, the United States government established three media organizations, Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, to carry out public opinion warfare and implement peaceful evolution. Since the 1980s, with the rapid development of the Internet, the United States has exploited its technological advantages and mainly targeted young people to spread American ideology, values and cultural products through the Internet. The U.S. manipulated international public opinion, influenced or even directly incited the people of relevant countries to confront the government. On February 25, 2022, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton incited U.S. hackers to launch cyber attacks against Russia in an interview. She said, “we could be also attacking a lot of the government institutions and oligarchs and their way of life through cyber attacks. We did some of that during the Arab Spring when I was Secretary of State.”◆The US government uses social media to fabricate war lies to justify foreign interference. In 2019,the Washington Postexposed a federal program government document that included interviews with more than 400 key figures involved in the war in Afghanistan, including US military sources, diplomats, military contractors, Afghan officials and others. The documents show that the US government tried to cover up the comments of the respondents and hide evidence that the war was unwinnable, and that senior officials never told the public the truth during the 18-year war in Afghanistan, making it difficult for the people to obtain true information. A 2008 document released by the National Security Archive revealed that the Bush administration had strengthened the charges against Iraq by pressuring the intelligence community and selectively releasing evidence favorable to the government's position, to legitimize the war. The document also mentions several instances of such \"politicization of intelligence.\" For example, people involved say that if a CIA staff provided different information from what the Bush administration wanted , his career would be at risk. The facts after the war in Iraq indicate that Iraq has not been found to have weapons of mass destruction or be associated with Al-Qaida. In the United States, widespread suspicion and criticism of the government's manipulation of public opinion and misleading of the people arose.◆The US military uses social media to manipulate topics and deceptive propaganda to influence other countries' perceptions. US Central Command had signed a software development agreement with a California-based software company to manipulate social media through fake online personas and influence people in Middle Eastern countries. In 2022, Twitter released internal documents to the website \"The Intercept,\" exposing the US military's use of social media to carry out disinformation campaigns justifying its indiscriminate killing of citizens of other countries. The Defense Department had developed a \"white list\" that would require Twitter to prioritize services for the agencies on the list. Central Command official Nathaniel Kahle requested Twitter in July 2017 to prioritize six US government Arabic-language accounts that promoted \"the precision of US drone military strikes in Yemen, with terrorists, not civilians, being killed. \"◆The United States prides itself on \"freedom of speech,\" while it applies double standards to other countries. In August 2022, the Stanford Internet Observatory released a study titled Unheard Voices: Evaluating Five Years of Pro-Western Covert Influence Operations. It revealed a network of interconnected accounts on social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram that use deception to promote pro-Western rhetoric in regions such as the Middle East and Central Asia, touting the US government, attacking and smearing countries such as China, Russia and Iran. Some accounts also use artificial intelligence technology to create fake personal profiles and spread disinformation. The United States also uses various means to \"silence\" foreign media. Russian mainstream media such as RT TV and Sputnik News Agency have been banned from the United States and Europe. Russian official accounts have been restricted by platforms such as Twitter, Russian channels and mobile apps have been removed from Apple and Google App stores. Russia-related content is subject to extreme scrutiny.◆The United States, under the guise of \"freedom of speech,\" viciously attacks and smears China. Some US politicians have not only wantonly fabricated false statements such as hyping up \"Chinese virus\" and \"Wuhan virus,\" and other untrue remarks, but also attacked media reports that objectively reflected China's fight against the pandemic. According to US media reports, the White House published an article on its official website criticizing the media for taking US taxpayers' money to \"promote China.\" NBC and CNN have also been accused by the White House of \"China's puppet\" and \"public enemy \" for affirming China's anti-epidemic performance in their reports.◆American media has one-sided interpretation of news events and malicious coverage of China-related news. The US media interpreted the withdrawal of American universities from the World University and Professional Rankings as a righteous act against the tyranny of American higher education, but interpreted the withdrawal of some Chinese universities from the world rankings as China's \"closed-door policy\" in the field of science. Some US politicians and media denounced the US people's siege of the Capitol over the presidential election as riots. The street violence in Hong Kong, China,however, has been glorified as \"the pursuit of democracy and freedom\" and \"the beautiful sight.\"◆The US pursues a double standard of freedom of speech in the Internet field, stigmatizing China as \"digital authoritarianism,\" and calling India \"the digital Internet shutdown capital.\" At the same time, it promoted the formation of the \"Internet Future Alliance,\" which claimed to build \"an open, free, global, interoperable, reliable and secure future\" while excluding China, Russia and other countries. In doing so,the US attempts to form a closed and exclusive small circle and create a digital divide and bloc confrontation in the Internet field.◆The United States uses \"freedom of speech and press\" to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and subvert their regimes. In 1970, under the guise of \"freedom of the press,\" CIA launched a large-scale smear campaign against the Chilean government of Allende, scouting about for newspapers and magazines outside Chile to publish articles that attacked and smeared Allende. It also supported the opposition to seize media platforms, instigated anti-government actions, and collaborated with political forces such as the Chilean military and the Organization of American States and other Latin American countries to eventually topple Allende's government.◆The U.S. instigates color revolutions with the help of \"freedom of speech.\" Taking advantage of the instability of some newly independent countries after the collapse of the Soviet Union, it supported and used the media to advocate Western democracy, to produce and disseminate negative news about local governments and leaders, and to help the opposition promote political rhetoric. For example, the establishment of \"information centers for democracy\" in Azerbaijan and Kyrgyzstan was publicly announced to assist in the development of local \"independent media\", and to influence and promote the \"democratization process\" in those countries. During Kyrgyzstan's parliamentary elections, the US-backed Aztec radio station trumpeted opposition and pro-Western views to shape public opinion for regime change.◆American social networking sites spread a large number of false information to hinder the Democratic Republic of Congo(DRC) government's efforts to fight the Ebola epidemic. In 2018, following another Ebola outbreak in the DRC, social media such as Twitter and Facebook spread suspicions saying that the outbreak did not exist and questioning the government's rhetoric about its response to the disease, which caused severe disruption to the local fight against the Ebola epidemic. A 2019 study in the medical journalThe Lancetnoted that false information had led a quarter of locals to believe Ebola did not exist and a third to believe the virus was only used to destabilize the region.◆American international journalists often suffer unwarranted repression. According to US media reports, in June 2010, Helen Thomas, a well-known journalist aged 89, was asked to comment on Israel when she attended a White House celebration of Jewish American History Month. She was forced to terminate her career as she replied “get the hell out of Palestine.” In May 2021,Associated Pressreporter Emily Wilder was fired for \"violating social media policy\" for posting pro-Palestinian tweets. In February 2023, veteran investigative journalist Seymour Hersh, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, released an investigation revealing that the US government was behind the bombing of the Nord Stream gas pipeline. US national security council spokesman declared that Hersh’s article about the Biden administration blowing up the Nord Stream pipeline was false information and pure fabrication, and attacked Hersh.ConclusionFreedom of speech in the United States is one for domestic politicians and interest groups, and another for ordinary people. It is one way of saying and doing things about the United States, and another way of saying and doing things about other countries. The United States issued a report to baselessly smear and accuse other countries of spreading \"disinformation,\" but the United States is the source of disinformation and the command post of \"cognitive warfare\" throughout the world. Today's world is not at a time when a lie repeated thousands of times can become the truth, or smearing others can whitewash oneself. The eyes of the people of the world are bright. No matter how the United States propagates its freedom of speech, and how it spares no effort to blame other countries for spreading \"false information\" , it cannot change the fact that more and more people are seeing through the ugly practices of the United States: how it relies on lies to weave \"the emperor's new clothes,\" and how it smears others to maintain its hegemony.Links:State CouncilMinistry of CommerceNational Development and Reform CommissionNational Immigration AdministrationCopyright©www.fmprc.gov.cnAddress: 2 Chaoyangmen Nandajie, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100701Tel: 86 - 10 - 65961114\n","Country: United States\n","Continent: America\n","Developed country: 1\n","Developing country: 0\n","Communist country: 0\n","Original Source: https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xw/wjbxw/202405/t20240530_11343951.html\n","---\n"," FULL RECORD:\n","Name: Special Representative of the Chinese Government on Eurasian Affairs Li Hui Holds Talks with Official in Charge of the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs of France\n","Year: 2024\n","Level: None\n","Text: Special Representative of the Chinese Government on Eurasian Affairs Li Hui Holds Talks with Official in Charge of the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs of France_Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of ChinaIPCVisasEnglishEN简体中文FrançaisРусскийEspañolعربيMinistry of Foreign AffairsThe People’s Republic of ChinaThe MinistryMain ResponsibilitiesThe MinisterPrincipal OfficialsDepartmentsRelated AgenciesNewsTop StoriesSpeechesDiplomatic ScheduleNew AmbassadorsMFA NewsSpokesperson’s RemarksNews from Overseas MissionsResourcesCommuniquésForeign PoliciesIn FocusDiplomatic HistoryDiplomatic FiguresProtocol AffairsOverseas MissionsChinese EmbassiesChinese Consulates GeneralChinese Missions to International Organizations and Representative Offices AbroadCountries and RegionsAsiaAfricaEuropeNorth AmericaSouth AmericaOceaniaABOUT CHINAHOMETHE MINISTRYMain ResponsibilitiesThe MinisterPrincipal OfficialsDepartmentsRelated AgenciesNEWSTop StoriesSpeechesDiplomatic ScheduleNew AmbassadorsMFA NewsSpokesperson’s RemarksNews from Overseas MissionsRESOURCESCommuniquésForeign PoliciesIn FocusDiplomatic HistoryDiplomatic FiguresProtocol AffairsOVERSEAS MISSIONSChinese EmbassiesChinese Consulates GeneralChinese Missions to International Organizations and Representative Offices AbroadCOUNTRIES AND REGIONSAsiaAfricaEuropeNorth AmericaSouth AmericaOceaniaABOUT CHINAHomeNewsMFA NewsSpecial Representative of the Chinese Government on Eurasian Affairs Li Hui Holds Talks with Official in Charge of the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs of FranceUpdated:March 13, 2024 16:51On March 11, 2024, Special Representative of the Chinese Government on Eurasian Affairs Li Hui held talks with Deputy Director General for Political Affairs and Security of the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs of France Jonathan Lacôte in Paris, and they had an extensive exchange of views on China-France relations, the Ukraine crisis, as well as other topics of mutual interest and concern.

Recent years have witnessed close exchanges at all levels between China and Malta. Last year, the foreign ministers of the two countries visited each other and reached broad consensus on further strengthening China-Malta bilateral and multilateral cooperation. China appreciates Malta's adherence to the one-China policy, and stands ready to strengthen communication and coordination with Malta in multilateral mechanisms including the UN Security Council, and jointly promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.Neville Aquilina appreciated China's role as a responsible major country in promoting political settlement of hotspot issues and maintaining international peace and security, thanked China for supporting Malta in serving as a non-permanent member of the Security Council, and expressed the willingness to strengthen coordination and cooperation with China to safeguard multilateralism and promote world peace and development.Links:State CouncilMinistry of CommerceNational Development and Reform CommissionNational Immigration AdministrationCopyright©www.fmprc.gov.cnAddress: 2 Chaoyangmen Nandajie, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100701Tel: 86 - 10 - 65961114\n","Country: Malta\n","Continent: Europe\n","Developed country: 1\n","Developing country: 0\n","Communist country: 0\n","Original Source: https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xw/wjbxw/202405/t20240530_11343949.html\n","---\n"," FULL RECORD:\n","Name: Director-General of the Department of International Organizations and Conferences of the Foreign Ministry Shen Bo Holds Consultations on the UN Security Council Affairs with Director General of the Ministry for Foreign and European Affairs and Trade of Malta\n","Year: 2024\n","Level: None\n","Text: Director-General of the Department of International Organizations and Conferences of the Foreign Ministry Shen Bo Holds Consultations on the UN Security Council Affairs with Director General of the Ministry for Foreign and European Affairs and Trade of Malta_Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of ChinaIPCVisasEnglishEN简体中文FrançaisРусскийEspañolعربيMinistry of Foreign AffairsThe People’s Republic of ChinaThe MinistryMain ResponsibilitiesThe MinisterPrincipal OfficialsDepartmentsRelated AgenciesNewsTop StoriesSpeechesDiplomatic ScheduleNew AmbassadorsMFA NewsSpokesperson’s RemarksNews from Overseas MissionsResourcesCommuniquésForeign PoliciesIn FocusDiplomatic HistoryDiplomatic FiguresProtocol AffairsOverseas MissionsChinese EmbassiesChinese Consulates GeneralChinese Missions to International Organizations and Representative Offices AbroadCountries and RegionsAsiaAfricaEuropeNorth AmericaSouth AmericaOceaniaABOUT CHINAHOMETHE MINISTRYMain ResponsibilitiesThe MinisterPrincipal OfficialsDepartmentsRelated AgenciesNEWSTop StoriesSpeechesDiplomatic ScheduleNew AmbassadorsMFA NewsSpokesperson’s RemarksNews from Overseas MissionsRESOURCESCommuniquésForeign PoliciesIn FocusDiplomatic HistoryDiplomatic FiguresProtocol AffairsOVERSEAS MISSIONSChinese EmbassiesChinese Consulates GeneralChinese Missions to International Organizations and Representative Offices AbroadCOUNTRIES AND REGIONSAsiaAfricaEuropeNorth AmericaSouth AmericaOceaniaABOUT CHINAHomeNewsMFA NewsDirector-General of the Department of International Organizations and Conferences of the Foreign Ministry Shen Bo Holds Consultations on the UN Security Council Affairs with Director General of the Ministry for Foreign and European Affairs and Trade of MaltaUpdated:March 12, 2024 22:37On March 12, 2024, Director-General of the Department of International Organizations and Conferences of the Foreign Ministry Shen Bo held consultations on the UN Security Council affairs with visiting Director General of Global Issues, International Development and Economic Affairs of the Ministry for Foreign and European Affairs and Trade of Malta Neville Aquilina in Beijing.

It is a grave concern of the international community. President Xi Jinping stated China’s principled position on the current Palestinian-Israeli situation on a number of occasions. He stressed the need for an immediate ceasefire and ending the fighting, ensuring that the humanitarian corridors are safe and unimpeded, and preventing the expansion of the conflict. He pointed out that the fundamental way out of this lies in the two-state solution, building international consensus for peace, and working toward a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the Palestinian question at an early date.Pursuant to the Charter of the United Nations, the Security Council shoulders primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, and should thus play an active and constructive role on the question of Palestine. In this connection, China offers the following proposals:1. Implementing a comprehensive ceasefire and ending the fighting. Parties to the conflict should truly implement the relevant UNGA and UNSC resolutions and immediately realize a durable and sustained humanitarian truce. Building on UNSC Resolution 2712, the Security Council, in response to the calls of the international community, should explicitly demand a comprehensive ceasefire and end of the fighting, work for deescalation of the conflict, and cool down the situation as soon as possible.2. Protecting civilians effectively. The UNSC resolution demands in explicit terms that all parties comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law, notably with regard to the protection of civilians. It is imperative to stop any violent attacks against civilians and violations of international humanitarian law, and avoid attacks on civilian facilities. The Security Council should further send a clear message on opposing forced transfer of the Palestinian civilian population, preventing the displacement of Palestinian civilians, and calling for the release of all civilians and hostages held captive as soon as possible.3. Ensuring humanitarian assistance. All relevant parties must, as per requirements of the UNSC resolution, refrain from depriving the civilian population in Gaza of supplies and services indispensable to their survival, set up humanitarian corridors in Gaza to enable rapid, safe, unhindered and sustainable humanitarian access, and avoid a humanitarian disaster of even greater gravity. The Security Council should encourage the international community to ramp up humanitarian assistance, improve the humanitarian situation on the ground, and support the coordinating role of the United Nations as well as the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) in humanitarian assistance, and prepare the international community for supporting post-conflict reconstruction in Gaza.4. Enhancing diplomatic mediation. The Security Council should leverage its role in facilitating peace as mandated in the UN Charter to demand that parties to the conflict exercise restraint to prevent the conflict from widening and uphold peace and stability in the Middle East. The Security Council should value the role of regional countries and organizations, support the good offices of the UN Secretary General and the Secretariat, and encourage countries with influence on parties to the conflict to uphold an objective and just position so as to jointly play a constructive role in deescalating the crisis.5. Seeking political settlement. According to relevant UNSC resolutions and international consensus, the fundamental settlement of the question of Palestine lies in the implementation of the two-state solution, restoration of the legitimate national rights of Palestine, and the establishment of an independent State of Palestine that enjoys full sovereignty based on the 1967 border and with east Jerusalem as its capital. The Security Council should help restore the two-state solution. A more broad-based, authoritative and effective international peace conference led and organized by the UN should be held as soon as possible to formulate a concrete timetable and roadmap for the implementation of the two-state solution and facilitate a comprehensive, just and lasting solution to the question of Palestine. Any arrangement on the future of Gaza must respect the will and independent choice of the Palestinian people, and must not be imposed upon them.Links:State CouncilMinistry of CommerceNational Development and Reform CommissionNational Immigration AdministrationCopyright©www.fmprc.gov.cnAddress: 2 Chaoyangmen Nandajie, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100701Tel: 86 - 10 - 65961114\n","Country: Israel\n","Continent: Asia\n","Developed country: 1\n","Developing country: 0\n","Communist country: 0\n","Original Source: https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xw/wjbxw/202405/t20240530_11343804.html\n","---\n","\n","Visiting page 112: https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xw/wjbxw/index_111.html\n"," FULL RECORD:\n","Name: China and France Hold the 6th Round of Consular Consultations\n","Year: 2023\n","Level: None\n","Text: China and France Hold the 6th Round of Consular Consultations_Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of ChinaIPCVisasEnglishEN简体中文FrançaisРусскийEspañolعربيMinistry of Foreign AffairsThe People’s Republic of ChinaThe MinistryMain ResponsibilitiesThe MinisterPrincipal OfficialsDepartmentsRelated AgenciesNewsTop StoriesSpeechesDiplomatic ScheduleNew AmbassadorsMFA NewsSpokesperson’s RemarksNews from Overseas MissionsResourcesCommuniquésForeign PoliciesIn FocusDiplomatic HistoryDiplomatic FiguresProtocol AffairsOverseas MissionsChinese EmbassiesChinese Consulates GeneralChinese Missions to International Organizations and Representative Offices AbroadCountries and RegionsAsiaAfricaEuropeNorth AmericaSouth AmericaOceaniaABOUT CHINAHOMETHE MINISTRYMain ResponsibilitiesThe MinisterPrincipal OfficialsDepartmentsRelated AgenciesNEWSTop StoriesSpeechesDiplomatic ScheduleNew AmbassadorsMFA NewsSpokesperson’s RemarksNews from Overseas MissionsRESOURCESCommuniquésForeign PoliciesIn FocusDiplomatic HistoryDiplomatic FiguresProtocol AffairsOVERSEAS MISSIONSChinese EmbassiesChinese Consulates GeneralChinese Missions to International Organizations and Representative Offices AbroadCOUNTRIES AND REGIONSAsiaAfricaEuropeNorth AmericaSouth AmericaOceaniaABOUT CHINAHomeNewsMFA NewsChina and France Hold the 6th Round of Consular ConsultationsUpdated:November 28, 2023 23:55On November 28, 2023, Director-General of the Department of Consular Affairs of the Foreign Ministry Wu Xi and Director for French Nationals Abroad and Consular Administration of the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs of France Pauline Carmona co-chaired the 6th round of consular consultations between China and France in Beijing.

Zhai Jun highlighted the three pressing tasks. First, stop the fighting as soon as possible and prevent the situation from further deteriorating or even spiraling out of control; second, urge parties related to the conflict to strictly abide by international humanitarian law, do their utmost to protect civilians, and prevent a wider range of humanitarian disaster; third, the international community should redouble diplomatic efforts to bring the crisis back to the track of political settlement.

The two sides had an exchange of views on China-Jordan relations and the current situation between Palestine and Israel.Zhai Jun said that China is deeply concerned about the current deteriorating situation in Gaza and the severe humanitarian crisis. The international community, the UN Security Council in particular, should take action and concrete measures to promote an early ceasefire and cessation of hostilities. At the same time, it is necessary to take a long-term view and create conditions for the resumption of the peace process in the Middle East on the basis of the two-state solution and \"land for peace\". The relevant draft resolution presented by Jordan on behalf of Arab countries at the emergency special session of the UN General Assembly was adopted with a high number of votes, reflecting the strong call from the international community, especially Arab and Islamic countries, for a ceasefire and cessation of hostilities. As a co-sponsor of the draft resolution, China highly appreciates and supports Jordan's important and unique role at this critical juncture.Ayman Safadi said, the Palestine-Israel conflict has brought tremendous damage to Gaza and posed serious impacts on regional security and stability. Israel's collective punishment of civilians in Gaza only brings more turbulence and risks to the region, not peace. The root cause of the Palestine-Israel conflict is the denial of the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people. Only by correctly and comprehensively understanding the historical context of the Palestinian question can a way out for the political settlement of the question be found. Jordan appreciates China's just position at the United Nations (UN), the Security Council and other occasions, thanks China for participating in the co-sponsoring and voting for the draft resolution on the Palestine-Israel conflict presented by Jordan at the UN General Assembly, and stands ready to maintain communication and coordination with China to work for an early de-escalation of the Palestine-Israel situation.Links:State CouncilMinistry of CommerceNational Development and Reform CommissionNational Immigration AdministrationCopyright©www.fmprc.gov.cnAddress: 2 Chaoyangmen Nandajie, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100701Tel: 86 - 10 - 65961114\n","Country: Jordan\n","Continent: Asia\n","Developed country: 0\n","Developing country: 1\n","Communist country: 0\n","Original Source: https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xw/wjbxw/202405/t20240530_11343743.html\n","---\n"," FULL RECORD:\n","Name: Special Envoy of the Chinese Government on the Middle East Issue Zhai Jun Meets with Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East Philippe Lazzarini\n","Year: 2023\n","Level: None\n","Text: Special Envoy of the Chinese Government on the Middle East Issue Zhai Jun Meets with Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East Philippe Lazzarini_Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of ChinaIPCVisasEnglishEN简体中文FrançaisРусскийEspañolعربيMinistry of Foreign AffairsThe People’s Republic of ChinaThe MinistryMain ResponsibilitiesThe MinisterPrincipal OfficialsDepartmentsRelated AgenciesNewsTop StoriesSpeechesDiplomatic ScheduleNew AmbassadorsMFA NewsSpokesperson’s RemarksNews from Overseas MissionsResourcesCommuniquésForeign PoliciesIn FocusDiplomatic HistoryDiplomatic FiguresProtocol AffairsOverseas MissionsChinese EmbassiesChinese Consulates GeneralChinese Missions to International Organizations and Representative Offices AbroadCountries and RegionsAsiaAfricaEuropeNorth AmericaSouth AmericaOceaniaABOUT CHINAHOMETHE MINISTRYMain ResponsibilitiesThe MinisterPrincipal OfficialsDepartmentsRelated AgenciesNEWSTop StoriesSpeechesDiplomatic ScheduleNew AmbassadorsMFA NewsSpokesperson’s RemarksNews from Overseas MissionsRESOURCESCommuniquésForeign PoliciesIn FocusDiplomatic HistoryDiplomatic FiguresProtocol AffairsOVERSEAS MISSIONSChinese EmbassiesChinese Consulates GeneralChinese Missions to International Organizations and Representative Offices AbroadCOUNTRIES AND REGIONSAsiaAfricaEuropeNorth AmericaSouth AmericaOceaniaABOUT CHINAHomeNewsMFA NewsSpecial Envoy of the Chinese Government on the Middle East Issue Zhai Jun Meets with Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East Philippe LazzariniUpdated:October 30, 2023 12:37On October 29, 2023, Special Envoy of the Chinese Government on the Middle East Issue Zhai Jun met with Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) Philippe Lazzarini in Amman, the capital of Jordan.

Noting that the sharp escalation of the Palestine-Israel conflict has led to massive civilian casualties and humanitarian crises, he said China is deeply worried about that. The pressing task is to cease fire and stop fighting, open up passages for humanitarian rescue and assistance as soon as possible, and effectively relieve the suffering facing the people in Gaza. China supports Egypt in opening up corridors for humanitarian rescue and assistance to Gaza. China has already provided the people in Gaza with emergency humanitarian rescue and assistance, and will continue to do that. China and Egypt share similar positions on the Palestinian question, and China is ready to work with Egypt to jointly promote the international community to form synergy for peace, and bring the Palestinian question back on the track of a political settlement at an early date.Noting that the current humanitarian situation in Gaza is dangerous, Osama Khedr said the international community should take a just and balanced position, oppose Israel's \"group punishment\" of the people in Gaza, and push more humanitarian assistance to enter Gaza. Egypt highly appreciates China for upholding a just position on the Palestinian question for a long time, thanks China for supporting Egypt in hosting the Summit for Peace and supporting Egypt's efforts to relieve the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and looks forward to working with China to carry out conciliation and mediation, so as to avoid further escalation of the Palestine-Israel conflict.During his visit to Egypt, Zhai Jun also gave an interview to the Egyptian ECHO, Al Qahera News, Xinhua News Agency, China Media Group, Phoenix TV, and other media outlets, expounded China's position on the current Palestine-Israel situation, and introduced China's efforts to deescalate the conflict and promote talks for peace.Links:State CouncilMinistry of CommerceNational Development and Reform CommissionNational Immigration AdministrationCopyright©www.fmprc.gov.cnAddress: 2 Chaoyangmen Nandajie, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100701Tel: 86 - 10 - 65961114\n","Country: Egypt\n","Continent: Africa\n","Developed country: 0\n","Developing country: 1\n","Communist country: 0\n","Original Source: https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xw/wjbxw/202405/t20240530_11343717.html\n","---\n"," FULL RECORD:\n","Name: Special Envoy on Afghan Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Yue Xiaoyong Meets with Foreign Secretary of Pakistan Muhammad Syrus Sajjad Qazi\n","Year: 2023\n","Level: None\n","Text: Special Envoy on Afghan Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Yue Xiaoyong Meets with Foreign Secretary of Pakistan Muhammad Syrus Sajjad Qazi_Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of ChinaIPCVisasEnglishEN简体中文FrançaisРусскийEspañolعربيMinistry of Foreign AffairsThe People’s Republic of ChinaThe MinistryMain ResponsibilitiesThe MinisterPrincipal OfficialsDepartmentsRelated AgenciesNewsTop StoriesSpeechesDiplomatic ScheduleNew AmbassadorsMFA NewsSpokesperson’s RemarksNews from Overseas MissionsResourcesCommuniquésForeign PoliciesIn FocusDiplomatic HistoryDiplomatic FiguresProtocol AffairsOverseas MissionsChinese EmbassiesChinese Consulates GeneralChinese Missions to International Organizations and Representative Offices AbroadCountries and RegionsAsiaAfricaEuropeNorth AmericaSouth AmericaOceaniaABOUT CHINAHOMETHE MINISTRYMain ResponsibilitiesThe MinisterPrincipal OfficialsDepartmentsRelated AgenciesNEWSTop StoriesSpeechesDiplomatic ScheduleNew AmbassadorsMFA NewsSpokesperson’s RemarksNews from Overseas MissionsRESOURCESCommuniquésForeign PoliciesIn FocusDiplomatic HistoryDiplomatic FiguresProtocol AffairsOVERSEAS MISSIONSChinese EmbassiesChinese Consulates GeneralChinese Missions to International Organizations and Representative Offices AbroadCOUNTRIES AND REGIONSAsiaAfricaEuropeNorth AmericaSouth AmericaOceaniaABOUT CHINAHomeNewsMFA NewsSpecial Envoy on Afghan Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Yue Xiaoyong Meets with Foreign Secretary of Pakistan Muhammad Syrus Sajjad QaziUpdated:October 23, 2023 12:32On October 19, 2023, Special Envoy on Afghan Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Yue Xiaoyong met with Foreign Secretary of Pakistan Muhammad Syrus Sajjad Qazi in Beijing.

China and Russia have the same position on the Palestinian question, and China is ready to maintain communication and coordination with Russia to promote de-escalation of the situation, and play a positive role in resuming talks for peace between Palestine and Israel, truly implementing the two-state solution, and promoting a comprehensive, just and enduring solution to the Palestinian question at an early date.Bogdanov Mikhail Leonidovich said that Russia closely follows the development of the current Palestine-Israel situation, and is concerned over the current humanitarian crisis facing Palestine. The international community should work together to avoid the further escalation of the crisis and spillover to the outside of the region.

He noted that the complete success of this visit has injected fresh impetus into the development of China-South Africa comprehensive strategic partnership.During the visit, President Xi Jinping held talks with President Cyril Ramaphosa. The two heads of state had an in-depth exchange of views on the development of China-South Africa and China-Africa relations and international and regional issues of mutual interest, and reached important common understandings on a number of issues. President Ramaphosa personally greeted President Xi Jinping at the airport, held a welcoming ceremony for President Xi at the President's official residence, and conferred on President Xi the Order of South Africa, the highest decoration and honor South Africa awards to the heads of state of friendly countries. The two heads of state jointly witnessed the signing of 11 cooperation documents on Belt and Road, new energy power, agricultural product, special economic zone, industrial park, blue economy, scientific and technological innovation, and higher education, and met the press together.The two sides also issued a Joint Statement between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of South Africa. South Africa reaffirmed its firm commitment to the one-China policy, and expressed the view that the Chinese path to modernization has offered South Africa a lot of experience, and that South Africa appreciates China's leading role in promoting global peace and cooperation. China pledged to continue to support South Africa in meeting energy security challenges and support South Africa's BRICS chairmanship this year. The two sides will work together to build a high-level China-South Africa community with a shared future, continue to support each other on issues concerning each other's core interests and major concerns, and further strengthen cooperation in international affairs.Wu Peng stressed that this year marks the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and South Africa. Over the past 25 years, bilateral relations have achieved leapfrog development, acquiring increasing strategic significance and global influence. Especially in recent years, under the joint attention and guidance of President Xi Jinping and President Ramaphosa, the China-South Africa relationship has entered a \"golden era\". The two heads of state agreed that the key to the strong relations and deep friendship between China and South Africa lies in the fact that the two countries and the two political parties have stood together through thick and thin in their respective pursuit of development and forged deep bonds of \"comrades-plus-brothers\" friendship. Going forward, the two sides will seek greater synergy between development strategies, step up cooperation in such areas as infrastructure building, energy transition and poverty reduction, jointly explore new growth drivers for cooperation, and firmly pursue the paths to modernization suited to their respective national conditions. Wu said this year is the \"Year of South Africa\" for BRICS. China supports South Africa in hosting the 15th BRICS Summit, and will work together with South Africa to promote progress in BRICS membership expansion, and jointly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries.Wu then gave a brief on the upcoming China-Africa Leaders' Dialogue in answering relevant questions. He also answered questions on China-South Africa cooperation on Belt and Road, economy and trade, energy, people-to-people and cultural exchanges, tourism, and inter-party exchanges as well as questions on China-Africa cooperation, investment in Africa, and peace and security in Africa, among others.Journalists from more than 30 Chinese and foreign media, including the Mail and Guardian, and Business Times of South Africa, BRICS Africa Channel, Reuters, L'Agence France-Presse (AFP), the Economist, People's Daily, Xinhua News Agency, China Media Group (CMG), China Daily, China News Service, Phoenix TV, and Global Times, were present at the briefing.Links:State CouncilMinistry of CommerceNational Development and Reform CommissionNational Immigration AdministrationCopyright©www.fmprc.gov.cnAddress: 2 Chaoyangmen Nandajie, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100701Tel: 86 - 10 - 65961114\n","Country: South Africa\n","Continent: Africa\n","Developed country: 0\n","Developing country: 1\n","Communist country: 0\n","Original Source: https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xw/wjbxw/202405/t20240530_11343618.html\n","---\n"," FULL RECORD:\n","Name: Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong Makes Solemn Representations on Japan's Announcement to Start Discharging the Fukushima Nuclear-contaminated Water into the Ocean\n","Year: 2023\n","Level: None\n","Text: Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong Makes Solemn Representations on Japan's Announcement to Start Discharging the Fukushima Nuclear-contaminated Water into the Ocean_Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of ChinaIPCVisasEnglishEN简体中文FrançaisРусскийEspañolعربيMinistry of Foreign AffairsThe People’s Republic of ChinaThe MinistryMain ResponsibilitiesThe MinisterPrincipal OfficialsDepartmentsRelated AgenciesNewsTop StoriesSpeechesDiplomatic ScheduleNew AmbassadorsMFA NewsSpokesperson’s RemarksNews from Overseas MissionsResourcesCommuniquésForeign PoliciesIn FocusDiplomatic HistoryDiplomatic FiguresProtocol AffairsOverseas MissionsChinese EmbassiesChinese Consulates GeneralChinese Missions to International Organizations and Representative Offices AbroadCountries and RegionsAsiaAfricaEuropeNorth AmericaSouth AmericaOceaniaABOUT CHINAHOMETHE MINISTRYMain ResponsibilitiesThe MinisterPrincipal OfficialsDepartmentsRelated AgenciesNEWSTop StoriesSpeechesDiplomatic ScheduleNew AmbassadorsMFA NewsSpokesperson’s RemarksNews from Overseas MissionsRESOURCESCommuniquésForeign PoliciesIn FocusDiplomatic HistoryDiplomatic FiguresProtocol AffairsOVERSEAS MISSIONSChinese EmbassiesChinese Consulates GeneralChinese Missions to International Organizations and Representative Offices AbroadCOUNTRIES AND REGIONSAsiaAfricaEuropeNorth AmericaSouth AmericaOceaniaABOUT CHINAHomeNewsMFA NewsVice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong Makes Solemn Representations on Japan's Announcement to Start Discharging the Fukushima Nuclear-contaminated Water into the OceanUpdated:August 22, 2023 23:00On August 22, 2023, Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong summoned Japanese Ambassador to China Tarumi Hideo, and made solemn representations on the Japanese government's announcement to start discharging the Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean from August 24.Sun Weidong pointed out that in disregard of the strong doubts and opposition from the international community, the Japanese government announced the decision to start the discharge of the Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean. Such an act blatantly shifts the risks of nuclear pollution to neighboring countries, including China, and the international community, and puts its interests above the long-term well-being of people in the region and the world. It is extremely selfish and irresponsible. China expresses grave concern and strong opposition to it.Sun Weidong emphasized that the Fukushima nuclear accident is one of the world's most serious nuclear accidents to date, resulting in the release of a large amount of radioactive material, which has far-reaching implications for the marine environment, food safety, and human health. The ocean is the blue home that all humanity depends on for survival, and the Japanese side should not dump nuclear-contaminated water at will. Japan's act of pushing ahead with the discharge of nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean undoubtedly puts the global marine environment and the health of all humanity at high stakes. China strongly urges the Japanese side to revoke its wrong decision, stop pushing ahead with the nuclear-contaminated water discharge plan, communicate with its neighbors with sincerity and goodwill, and handle the matter responsibly, so as to avoid any unforeseeable damage and harm to the global marine environment. If Japan goes its way, the Chinese government will take necessary measures to firmly safeguard the marine environment, food safety, and public health.Links:State CouncilMinistry of CommerceNational Development and Reform CommissionNational Immigration AdministrationCopyright©www.fmprc.gov.cnAddress: 2 Chaoyangmen Nandajie, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100701Tel: 86 - 10 - 65961114\n","Country: Japan\n","Continent: Asia\n","Developed country: 1\n","Developing country: 0\n","Communist country: 0\n","Original Source: https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xw/wjbxw/202405/t20240530_11343617.html\n","---\n"," FULL RECORD:\n","Name: Special Representative of the Chinese Government on European Affairs Wu Hongbo Meets with Guests from Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kyrgyzstan\n","Year: 2023\n","Level: None\n","Text: Special Representative of the Chinese Government on European Affairs Wu Hongbo Meets with Guests from Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kyrgyzstan_Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of ChinaIPCVisasEnglishEN简体中文FrançaisРусскийEspañolعربيMinistry of Foreign AffairsThe People’s Republic of ChinaThe MinistryMain ResponsibilitiesThe MinisterPrincipal OfficialsDepartmentsRelated AgenciesNewsTop StoriesSpeechesDiplomatic ScheduleNew AmbassadorsMFA NewsSpokesperson’s RemarksNews from Overseas MissionsResourcesCommuniquésForeign PoliciesIn FocusDiplomatic HistoryDiplomatic FiguresProtocol AffairsOverseas MissionsChinese EmbassiesChinese Consulates GeneralChinese Missions to International Organizations and Representative Offices AbroadCountries and RegionsAsiaAfricaEuropeNorth AmericaSouth AmericaOceaniaABOUT CHINAHOMETHE MINISTRYMain ResponsibilitiesThe MinisterPrincipal OfficialsDepartmentsRelated AgenciesNEWSTop StoriesSpeechesDiplomatic ScheduleNew AmbassadorsMFA NewsSpokesperson’s RemarksNews from Overseas MissionsRESOURCESCommuniquésForeign PoliciesIn FocusDiplomatic HistoryDiplomatic FiguresProtocol AffairsOVERSEAS MISSIONSChinese EmbassiesChinese Consulates GeneralChinese Missions to International Organizations and Representative Offices AbroadCOUNTRIES AND REGIONSAsiaAfricaEuropeNorth AmericaSouth AmericaOceaniaABOUT CHINAHomeNewsMFA NewsSpecial Representative of the Chinese Government on European Affairs Wu Hongbo Meets with Guests from Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and KyrgyzstanUpdated:August 21, 2023 22:16On August 18, 2023, Special Representative of the Chinese Government on European Affairs Wu Hongbo met in Beijing with Former Serbian President Boris Tadic, Former Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina Zlatko Lagumdzija, Former Prime Minister of Kyrgyzstan Djoomart Otorbaev, who are visiting China at the invitation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.

On January 1 this year, President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden exchanged congratulatory letters on the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, emphasizing the commitment to stabilizing and developing the bilateral relationship for the benefits of both countries and the world. The three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation proposed by President Xi Jinping are the fundamental guidelines for China in handling its relationship with the United States. China and the United States should respect each other\\'s social systems and development paths, and refrain from interfering in each other\\'s internal affairs, obstructing or containing each other\\'s development, or undermining each other\\'s core interests.

It is a grave concern of the international community. President Xi Jinping stated China’s principled position on the current Palestinian-Israeli situation on a number of occasions. He stressed the need for an immediate ceasefire and ending the fighting, ensuring that the humanitarian corridors are safe and unimpeded, and preventing the expansion of the conflict. He pointed out that the fundamental way out of this lies in the two-state solution, building international consensus\\u2002for peace,\\u2002and working toward a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the Palestinian question at an early date.Pursuant to the Charter\\u2002of the United Nations, the Security Council shoulders\\u2002primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, and should thus play an\\u2002active and constructive role on the question of Palestine. In this connection, China\\u2002offers the following proposals:1.\\u2002Implementing a comprehensive ceasefire and ending the fighting. Parties to the conflict should truly implement the\\u2002relevant UNGA and UNSC resolutions and immediately realize a durable and sustained humanitarian truce.\\u2002Building on UNSC Resolution 2712, the Security Council, in\\u2002response to the calls\\u2002of the international community, should\\u2002explicitly demand a comprehensive ceasefire\\u2002and end of the fighting, work for deescalation of the conflict, and cool down the situation\\u2002as soon as possible.2.\\u2002Protecting\\u2002civilians\\u2002effectively. The UNSC resolution demands in explicit terms that all parties comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law, notably with regard to the protection of civilians. It is imperative to stop any violent attacks against civilians and violations of international humanitarian law,\\u2002and avoid attacks\\u2002on civilian facilities. The Security Council should\\u2002further send a clear message on opposing forced transfer of the Palestinian civilian population,\\u2002preventing the displacement of Palestinian civilians, and calling for the release of all civilians and hostages held captive\\u2002as soon as possible.3.\\u2002Ensuring\\u2002humanitarian assistance. All relevant parties must, as per requirements\\u2002of the UNSC resolution, refrain from depriving the civilian population in Gaza of supplies and services indispensable to their survival, set up humanitarian corridors in Gaza to enable rapid, safe, unhindered and sustainable humanitarian access, and avoid a humanitarian disaster of even greater gravity. The Security Council should encourage the international community to ramp up humanitarian assistance,\\u2002improve\\u2002the humanitarian situation on the ground, and support the coordinating role of\\u2002the\\u2002United Nations\\u2002as well as the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) in humanitarian assistance, and prepare the international community for supporting\\u2002post-conflict reconstruction in Gaza.4.\\u2002Enhancing diplomatic mediation. The Security Council should leverage its\\u2002role\\u2002in facilitating peace\\u2002as mandated\\u2002in the UN\\u2002Charter\\u2002to demand that parties to the conflict exercise restraint to prevent\\u2002the conflict from widening and uphold\\u2002peace and stability in the Middle East. The Security Council should value\\u2002the role of regional countries and organizations, support the good offices of the UN Secretary General and the Secretariat, and encourage countries with influence on parties to the conflict to uphold an objective and just\\u2002position\\u2002so as to jointly play\\u2002a constructive role in deescalating the crisis.5. Seeking political settlement. According\\u2002to relevant UNSC resolutions and\\u2002international consensus, the fundamental settlement of the question of Palestine lies in the\\u2002implementation of the two-state solution, restoration of the legitimate national rights of Palestine, and the\\u2002establishment of an independent State of Palestine that enjoys full sovereignty based on the 1967 border and with east Jerusalem as its capital. The Security Council should help restore the two-state solution. A more broad-based, authoritative and effective international peace conference led and organized by the UN should be held as soon as possible to formulate a concrete\\u2002timetable and roadmap for the implementation of the two-state solution\\u2002and facilitate a comprehensive, just and lasting solution to the question of Palestine. Any arrangement on the future of Gaza must respect the will and independent choice of the Palestinian people, and must not be imposed upon them.Links:State CouncilMinistry of CommerceNational Development and Reform CommissionNational Immigration AdministrationCopyright©www.fmprc.gov.cnAddress: 2 Chaoyangmen Nandajie, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100701Tel: 86 - 10 - 65961114\",\n","  'Country': 'Israel',\n","  'Continent': 'Asia',\n","  'Developed country': 1,\n","  'Developing country': 0,\n","  'Communist country': 0,\n","  'Original Source': 'https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xw/wjbxw/202405/t20240530_11343804.html'},\n"," {'Name': 'Xi Jinping',\n","  'Year': '2023',\n","  'Level': \"President of the People's Republic of China; General Secretary of the Communist Party of China\",\n","  'Text': \"Assistant Foreign Minister Nong Rong Meets with Newly-appointed Ambassador of Timor-Leste to China Maubere Lorosae da Silva Horta_Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of ChinaIPCVisasEnglishEN简体中文FrançaisРусскийEspañolعربيMinistry of Foreign AffairsThe People’s Republic of ChinaThe MinistryMain ResponsibilitiesThe MinisterPrincipal OfficialsDepartmentsRelated AgenciesNewsTop StoriesSpeechesDiplomatic ScheduleNew AmbassadorsMFA NewsSpokesperson’s RemarksNews from Overseas MissionsResourcesCommuniquésForeign PoliciesIn FocusDiplomatic HistoryDiplomatic FiguresProtocol AffairsOverseas MissionsChinese EmbassiesChinese Consulates GeneralChinese Missions to International Organizations and Representative Offices AbroadCountries and RegionsAsiaAfricaEuropeNorth AmericaSouth\\xa0AmericaOceaniaABOUT CHINAHOMETHE MINISTRYMain ResponsibilitiesThe MinisterPrincipal OfficialsDepartmentsRelated AgenciesNEWSTop StoriesSpeechesDiplomatic ScheduleNew AmbassadorsMFA NewsSpokesperson’s RemarksNews from Overseas MissionsRESOURCESCommuniquésForeign PoliciesIn FocusDiplomatic HistoryDiplomatic FiguresProtocol AffairsOVERSEAS MISSIONSChinese EmbassiesChinese Consulates GeneralChinese Missions to International Organizations and Representative Offices AbroadCOUNTRIES AND REGIONSAsiaAfricaEuropeNorth AmericaSouth\\xa0AmericaOceaniaABOUT CHINAHomeNewsMFA NewsAssistant Foreign Minister Nong Rong Meets with Newly-appointed Ambassador of Timor-Leste to China Maubere Lorosae da Silva HortaUpdated:November 24, 2023 23:45On November 24, 2023, Assistant Foreign Minister Nong Rong met with the newly-appointed Ambassador of Timor-Leste to China Maubere Lorosae da Silva Horta.Nong Rong welcomed Maubere Lorosae da Silva Horta to China for the assumption of his new post, and said that President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Kay Rala Xanana Gusmão jointly announced to upgrade the relationship between China and Timor-Leste to a comprehensive strategic partnership in September this year, opening a new chapter of bilateral relations.

The two heads of state had an in-depth exchange of views on the development of China-South Africa and China-Africa relations and international and regional issues of mutual interest, and reached important common understandings on a number of issues.
